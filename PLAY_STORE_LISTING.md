## Full Description (4000 chars max)
Ready for a fresh take on the world's most popular board game?

Tic Tac Toe: Last 3 Moves reinvents the classic game with one simple rule change that transforms everything: each player can only keep their last 3 moves on the board. When you place your 4th move, your oldest one disappears!

🎮 HOW IT WORKS
• Play on a standard 3×3 grid, taking turns as X and O
• Each player can only have 3 marks on the board at a time
• When you place your 4th mark, your 1st mark vanishes
• The oldest move fades out so you can plan ahead
• Get three in a row to win — but watch out, your winning line might disappear!

⚡ WHY IT'S DIFFERENT
Unlike regular Tic Tac Toe which often ends in a draw, Last 3 Moves creates an ever-changing board where strategy matters more than memorizing openings. Every move counts twice — once for where you place it, and once for what it replaces.

✨ FEATURES
• Clean, modern design with smooth animations
• Two-player local gameplay — play with friends & family
• Visual indicators showing which move will disappear next
• Instant new game — jump right back in
• No ads, no in-app purchases, no data collection
• Works completely offline
• Lightweight and fast

🧠 PERFECT FOR
• Game nights with friends and family
• Quick brain-teasing matches
• Teaching strategic thinking to kids
• Anyone who loves classic board games with a modern twist

No sign-up required. No internet needed. Just pure, strategic fun.
